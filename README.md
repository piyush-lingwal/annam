# Soil Classification Challenge

This repository contains the code for training and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for soil image classification, submitted to the Annam AI Hackathon 2025.

## Files
- `train.py`: Code for training the CNN model.
- `inference.py`: Code for loading the trained model and making predictions on the test set.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions (e.g., image preprocessing).
- `models/best_model.h5`: Saved trained model.
- `submission.csv`: Final predictions for the test set.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages.

## How to Run

### Train the Model
```bash
python train.py
